Guide to run the app
**************************
To run in localhost:
1. Run Server.java in the directory "x-traveler-server/src" the "edu.jhu...Control.main" package
   enter the port number you would like to use;
2. Open the code of the UserInterface (ClientSide code), modify the IP address in 
   SocketHelper.java class, which locates in "edu.jhu....util" package
   * Notice: if you are using emulator to run the code, the IPv4 should be 10.0.2.2
3. Set the port the same as the Server side
4. To test an existing user, use the following information (there are 10 preset users' information
   in the database):
   username: bob
   password: 001320

Structure of the App
**************************
Below is a brief description of different folders
1. /ClientSide
Contains all resources to run the client side. To run client side, we also need the /Shared folder.
2. /Shared 
Contains all the shared keys and key values for the successful communication between client side and server side.
3. /ServerSide
Contains all the resources to run the Server Side, including database.

**************************
Architecture of the App
**************************
1. Client Side. We are using Android Development Toolkit for GUI design and threads handling.
2. Server Side.We are using socket and JSON to communicate with client side. We have our own socket manager to manage ports open and close.
3. Database. We are using Hibernate to interface java and mysql. The Server side and Database run under the AMP (Apache, Mysql, PhP) framework.
